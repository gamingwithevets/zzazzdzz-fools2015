This is a very legit *downloader* that *downloads* an application that can give you a shiny Mew in Pokémon X and Y.  
Amazing! Right...?

# Backstory
It's April 1, 2015, and YouTuber [TheZZAZZGlitch](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKlA7qF9XKwu79ULYmVu28w) made [a new video on how to get a shiny Mew in Pokémon X and Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECrY7Dd_F0E). He put a link to a *very trustworthy* website that would download the tool... or would it...?

The website was hosted through Google Drive. Unfortunately, only four months later, Google stopped support for web hosting, and so, every website that was hosted with Google Drive stopped being hosted, including TheZZAZZGlitch's *downloader*.

I do watch ZZAZZ's videos, and this just makes me sad. So with a little documentation, I was able to obtain [the original HTML that was hosted](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_s2K4TDOCSTXzNja0N0cDZpbUE/view?usp=sharing), and from there I figured I should host it here.

Also, I wonder if this would become popular.

# Where can I visit this lovely "downloader"?
